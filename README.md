# CodingBat Java Solutions

This repository contains my organized solutions to the Java practice problems on [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java).  
All solutions are grouped by their original CodingBat categories so you can easily browse, reference, or compare approaches.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder corresponds to a CodingBat Java problem set:
